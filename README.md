Odin Project: Website - Recipes
Objective: Build a basic recipe website.
Purpose: Practice all of the HTML knowledge I have acquired to far via the Odin Project.
Misc: The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty, but it’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build my HTML chops; I will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.
